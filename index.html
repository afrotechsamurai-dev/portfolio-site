                        <h4>About Me</h4>
                        <p>I’m Ahmed “AJ” Glover—a software developer, entrepreneur, and storyteller who took the long road to code. 
                            My journey has been anything but linear. 
                            For nearly a decade, I worked as a paramedic, seeing life at its rawest and most urgent. 
                            I learned how to think clearly under pressure, make decisions when seconds matter, 
                            and stay calm when chaos hits. 
                            Those same instincts now fuel my approach to engineering—solving problems quickly, 
                            thoroughly, and with a deep sense of responsibility for the people on the other side of the screen.</p>
                        <p>
                            My portfolio is more than a collection of apps—it’s proof that you can re-engineer your life, 
                            one commit at a time. 
                            I’ve built and shipped MVPs for a proximity-based dating app, 
                            a contractor CRM, and several automation tools for small businesses. 
                            Along the way, I’ve become fluent in turning an idea into a working product—scoping features, 
                            writing clean, testable code, and iterating fast based on feedback.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe great software is like great storytelling—it connects with people, 
                            solves real problems, and leaves them better than it found them. 
                            If you’re looking for a developer who knows how to navigate uncertainty, 
                            adapt under pressure, and build with both precision and empathy, you’ve found him.
